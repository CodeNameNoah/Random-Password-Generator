# Password Generator Portfolio

This is where you can learn all about me!

## Description

I was eager to create a portfolio to showcase all my projects. In my portfolio you will find many past, current and future projects that will embody the assets of skills I have as a web develoepr.
This project was built to show future employers the extent of my skills and the culimnation of many courses I have taken thus far. Such skills compose of being able to construct a portfolio from scratch and being able to include features to create a responsive portfolio.
My portfolio ultimately educates any like-minded peers on how to refactor, implement semantic tags, and to enhance any site's ranking with satisfied accessibility standards on common search engines.
I was able to learn how to be more efficient with setting up style sheets to be organized to prevent headaches in the future when I may return to borrow or polish my skills.

The portfolio is built with an image of a penguin known as noot noot as the main image. Your eyes are met with an interesting combination of vivid colors and contrast. A navigation bar with texts that redirect you will be present. The portfolio as you scroll down shows sections of about my background information, my experiences, my projects, and my contacts along with interactive redirects when the icons are clicked on.
