# Password Generator 

Introducing my password generator, a powerful tool that produces highly secure passwords based on four different user-defined criteria. With this generator, users can choose whether to include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numerical values in their passwords, allowing for complete customization and maximum security. The generated passwords are completely random and cannot be guessed, ensuring that user accounts and sensitive information are kept safe and secure. This password generator is the perfect solution for anyone who values online security and needs to create strong, unique passwords quickly and easily.

## Description

I am a skilled JavaScript developer with a passion for building practical and useful tools. Recently, I decided to put my skills to the test by building a random password generator that allows users to specify their desired criteria.

To achieve this, I utilized my knowledge of JavaScript to create an interactive web application that guides users through the process of generating a secure password. The user interface of my password generator is intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that even those with minimal technical expertise can use it without difficulty.

One of the most impressive aspects of my password generator is its ability to cater to user preferences. Users can specify the length of their password, the types of characters they want to include (such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and even choose to exclude specific characters that they don't want to appear in their password.

To accomplish this, I utilized various JavaScript functions and libraries to ensure that the generated passwords are truly random and secure. I incorporated a strong encryption algorithm to ensure that the generated passwords are virtually impossible to guess or crack.

Overall, my random password generator is a testament to my impressive skills with JavaScript. I've built a tool that is not only functional and practical but also demonstrates my mastery of the language and my ability to create complex applications that can be used by anyone.
